A compilation of Machine Learning code that uses Machine Learning Algorithms to solve daily problems

1.NBADataKmeansClustering uses Machine Learning Algorithm of K Means Clustering to manipulate data from a csv file during the 2013 NBA season. In this problem we build a model that makes 5 separate clusters and secides which NBA player belongs to which cluster from their stats from that year. We then use Linear Regression to see what is the coreelation between number of points made by a player to assist.
